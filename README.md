# NapQOL

- random utility mods for WEBFISHING!

## Current Features:

- show total inventory value (what you would gain if you were to sell your whole inventory)

- faster rod casting animations (near-instant rather than one second each)
![fastreel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2227333-13da-42f6-8b14-9cd152937fb2)


## WIP:

- add button to tp to gambling shack (would be funny)

## Plans:

- auto collect buddies (for that grind)
- teleportation
  - make something like minecraft f3 menu (at least the coords part)
  - interactive menu allowing inputting coordinate values]
  - saved waypoints/coordinates?
- flying

unrelated but maybe i should make an api for gui modding once i manage to figure all that out with the above mods
