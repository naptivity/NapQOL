# NapQOL

- random utility mods for WEBFISHING!

## Current Features:

- show total inventory value (what you would gain if you were to sell your whole inventory)

- faster rod casting animations (near-instant rather than one second each)

## WIP:

- add button to tp to gambling shack (would be funny)

## Plans:

- auto collect buddies (for that grind)
- teleportation anywhere + flying (questionable permission)
