# NapQOL

- quality of life mods for webfishing

## Current Features:

- none lol

## Plans:

- auto-skip prompts after catching an item (theyre annoying)
- faster cast reset animation (instantly (or configurable) rather than one second)
- show total inventory value (what you would gain if you were to sell your whole inventory)
- auto/afk fishing (for that grind)
- auto collect buddies (for that grind)
- add button to tp to gambling shack (would be funny)
- teleportation anywhere + flying (questionable permission)
