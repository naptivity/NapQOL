# NapQOL

- quality of life mods for webfishing

## Current Features:

- show total inventory value (what you would gain if you were to sell your whole inventory)
![totalinvval](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aad6326-beeb-4b31-a334-074c569b9400)

- faster cast reset animation (instantly rather than one second)
![fastreel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0147ae92-5344-464f-9594-9f1d8c68c9c7)

## Plans:

- auto-skip prompts after catching an item (theyre annoying)
- faster cast deploy animation (maybe?)
- auto/afk fishing (for that grind)
- auto collect buddies (for that grind)
- add button to tp to gambling shack (would be funny)
- teleportation anywhere + flying (questionable permission)
